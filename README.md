This is my personal website. A place to show people what I'm up to and keep easy to access info about projects I'm involved in.

## Design

After taking a class that involved a single project with Bootstrap, I decided to overhaul the design of the website with a custom Bootstrap theme. Thanks to GitHub Pages, I was able to point my domain to the website and use it's SSL certification. 

## Testing

I test the website by launching a virtual machine that can act as a GIT remote. I have a hook on the remote that rebuilds the website with Jekyll. To make the testing more seamless, it also modifies the host the site is configured for.
