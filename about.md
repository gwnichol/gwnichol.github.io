Just a bit about me:

### Who am I?
<img src="/img/assets/picture-of-me.jpg" style="float: right; max-width:30%; height:auto;" />
I am a student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Kansas State University. 

The current things that I'm working on are programming my AVR ATMega328 microcontroller and learning various communication protocols to interface between them.
