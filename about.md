Just a bit about me:

### Who am I?
<img src="/images/assets/picture-of-me.jpg" style="float: right; max-width:30%; height:auto; transform: rotate(90deg);" />
I am a student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Kansas State University. 

The current things that I'm working on are programing my AVR ATMega328 microcontroller and learning various comunication protocols to interface between them.
