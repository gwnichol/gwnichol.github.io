Here is a poster that I created as an entry into the John Heinrich's Scholarly and Creative Activities Day competition at Fort
Hays State University. We used Poissonâ€™s equation for electric potential to map potential within a bounded region. The final
goal of the project was to map the electric potential within a charged vehicle.

Before we could get to that point we first
need to implement calculations for both two and three dimensional bounded regions. To reduce computational time, we used the
relaxation method. Then, we implemented a way to place objects into a three dimensional region using the STL file format.
Finally, we found a 3D model and ran the calculation. All programming was done in C++. One of the greatest challenges 
faced being computational time.

The actual poster is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10QqlWEdmsO1mPRL_njAH04C9y4jGwwpD/view?usp=sharing). At some point I will transfer the contents of the poster here.

The source code for this project has since been misplaced. It was hosted on a school gitlab server and I do not know of the status of that server. I'm also still looking through old hard drives to see if I can find it.
