Here is a post I'm making to come back to when I find useful special characters in VIM

`a̅` (the bar on top) : `Ctrl+Shift+v u 0305` : This is how to type any Unicode character. This one is `0305`

`∑` (Capital Sigma) : `Ctrl+k +Z` : These are the VIM built in shortcuts.

`∩` (Intersection) : `Ctrl+k (U` :

`∪` (Union) : `Ctrl+k )U` :

These are all the ones that I use so far.

You can use `:diagraphs` to find all the `Ctrl+k` characters.
Note the first column is the code to use, the second is the actual character, and the third is the Unicode equivalent.
